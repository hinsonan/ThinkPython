The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that
if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r).
As a base case, we can use gcd (a, 0) = a.
Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their
greatest common divisor.

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b) 

print(gcd(16, 8))
