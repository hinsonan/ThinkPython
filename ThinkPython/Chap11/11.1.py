Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a
dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to
check whether a string is in the dictionary.

    for line in file:
        word = line.strip()
        word_dict[word] = word
